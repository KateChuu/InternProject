# intern_project
This repo includes two pyqt practices and one ATE (automatic test equipment) system project I made during the internship in Merry.

## PyQt practices
#### simple_form
This practice allows users to type something, choose some options and submit, then the results will be displayed in the area in the down left corner. LineEdit, button, textBrowser, labels and so on are used here.

#### display_table

## ATE system
