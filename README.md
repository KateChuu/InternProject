# Intern_project
This repo includes two pyqt practices and one ATE (automatic test equipment) system project I made during the internship in Merry.

## PyQt practices
#### simple_form
This practice allows users to type something, choose some options and submit, then the results will be displayed in the area in the down left corner. LineEdit, button, textBrowser, labels and so on are used here.

#### display_table
This program connects to the database of a material warehouse of the company, printing the stocks and properties in the form of a table. Only the authorised user is allowed to connect to the database. The user can add or delete rows in the table by clicking buttons and entering data in the windows.

## ATE system
